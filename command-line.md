Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?

I would tell them that a command line is a way for us to communicate  with the computer using it's language which is code. We type in code to use the computer instead of using the mouse and clicking on the screen. Commands are made by using specific code which then we would be returned in answer in text.

List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.

pwd - displays our current directory
cd - used to navigate the directory
cd ~ - returns us to our 'home' directory
mkdir - creates a new directory
ls - shows what is in the current directory/folder
rmdir - removes a directory
cp - used to copy files/folders
mv - used to move files/folders
rm - used to remove files/folders
pushd - saves current location in directory to be able to returned to by
popd
